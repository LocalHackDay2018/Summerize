## Inspiration
As students, we have to do a huge amount of reading.
We thought how we can do it better and help other students to hack their studying experience.

## What it does
**Summerize** is a single page application that handles all the summarizing work for you - just give it an article or a URL to mess with.
It even gives a list of helpful keywords.
And... it also has a friendly chat bot. :slightly_smiling_face:
The chat bot will answer your questions based on the context.

## How we built it
With a lot of crying, tears and blood.
On top of it, we used Node.js and Express.js on the back-end and React.js on the front-end.
Under the hood **Summerize** uses a _Node.js library_ to provide a summary and the chat bot uses the _QnA Maker service from Microsoft AI_. To get the keywords & references **Summerize** uses _Microsoft Azure's Text Analytics API_.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning React was rough, since it was our first time trying it.
We had to go through the mix of tutorials online. We're also happy to have great friends to borrow an advice in critical moments.
Learning how to train the knowledge database via _QnA Maker service from Microsoft AI_ was also a huge deal. You should check out the video below!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have a working product by the end of 8 hours!
Also, we killed all the bugs thrown at us.

## What we learned
   * Microsoft Azure API
   * New Node.js libraries for the text processing
   * React.js
   * Dealing with merge conflicts
   * Teamwork and how to share snacks

## What's next for Summerize
   We're hoping to work on 2.0 to bring even more cool features.
